## Technical Implementation

### Development Guidelines for Vercel Deployment

#### TypeScript Configuration
- **CRITICAL**: Use `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` in tsconfig.json
- **Type Imports**: Always use `import type` for TypeScript types
  ```typescript
  // ✅ Correct
  import type { Chapter, Exam } from '../types';
  
  // ❌ Incorrect - will fail build
  import { Chapter, Exam } from '../types';
  ```
- **Strict Mode**: Enable all strict TypeScript checks
- **No Implicit Any**: Ensure all variables have explicit types

#### Tailwind CSS Configuration
- **CommonJS Configs**: Use `.cjs` extension for config files
  - `tailwind.config.cjs` instead of `.js`
  - `postcss.config.cjs` for PostCSS
- **Content Paths**: Explicitly define all content paths
  ```javascript
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ]
  ```
- **Vite Configuration**: Explicitly configure PostCSS in vite.config.ts
  ```typescript
  css: {
    postcss: {
      plugins: [
        tailwindcss('./tailwind.config.cjs'),
        autoprefixer,
      ],
    },
  }
  ```

#### Build & Deployment Best Practices
- **Branch Strategy**: 
  - Feature branches for development: `feature/[feature-name]`
  - Bug fix branches: `bugfix/[issue-name]`
  - Test locally before merging to main
  - Main branch auto-deploys to Vercel
- **Local Testing**: Always run `npm run build` before pushing
- **Bundle Size**: Keep chunks under 500KB
  - Use dynamic imports for large components
  - Implement code splitting
- **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for configuration
  - Never commit sensitive data
  - Use Vercel environment variables for production

#### Component Development Guidelines
- **File Structure**: One component per file
- **Props Interface**: Always define TypeScript interfaces for props
- **Default Props**: Use default parameters or defaultProps
- **Error Boundaries**: Wrap complex components
- **Loading States**: Always handle loading and error states
- **Accessibility**: Include ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

#### State Management
- **Zustand Store**: 
  - Separate slices for different domains
  - Use immer for immutable updates
  - Implement proper TypeScript typing
- **Local Storage**: 
  - Handle quota exceeded errors
  - Implement data compression for large datasets
  - Regular cleanup of old data
- **Performance**: 
  - Use React.memo for expensive components
  - Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
  - Debounce user inputs

#### CSS & Styling
- **Mobile First**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
- **Responsive Units**: Use rem/em instead of px where appropriate
- **CSS Variables**: Define theme variables in CSS
- **Animation Performance**: Use transform and opacity for animations
- **Print Styles**: Include print media queries

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Test utilities and store functions
- **Component Tests**: Test user interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Test critical user flows
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure WCAG compliance

- 100% activity time captured accurately
- Clear visibility of actual vs planned
- Actionable insights from analytics

## Phase 8 - Critical UX Overhaul (IN PROGRESS)

### 🏗️ Major Architectural Decision (August 28, 2025)

#### Problem Analysis from User Feedback
**Critical Issues Identified**:
1. **Cramped Layout**: Side-by-side view too dense for 9th graders
2. **Poor Visibility**: Calendar cells too small to read chapter names
3. **Information Overload**: Everything visible at once overwhelms users
4. **Inconsistent State**: Tabs not syncing with matrix changes
5. **Touch Targets**: Buttons too small for mobile/tablet use

#### Architectural Solution: Tab-Based Component Layout

**New Design Principles**:
1. **One Focus Area**: Each component gets full viewport when active
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show only what's needed, expand on demand
3. **Context-Aware UI**: Sidebar/panels appear based on current view
4. **Mobile-First**: Design for smallest screen, enhance for larger

**Implementation Architecture**:
```
MatrixPlannerView (Redesigned)
├── Header Bar (Fixed)
│   ├── Title & Help
│   └── View Switcher [Chapters | Calendar | Analytics]
├── Context Sidebar (Collapsible)
│   ├── Quick Actions (in Chapters view)
│   ├── Subject List with Counts
│   └── Export/Import Tools
└── Main Content Area (Full Width)
    ├── Chapters View: Full-width matrix table
    ├── Calendar View: Large cells, zoom controls
    └── Analytics View: Charts and metrics
```

**Space Allocation Strategy**:
- **Chapters View**: 80% table, 20% sidebar (collapsible to 5%)
- **Calendar View**: 100% calendar (no sidebar)
- **Analytics View**: 100% metrics (no sidebar)
- **Mobile**: Stack vertically, hide sidebar by default

### Implementation Progress

#### ✅ 8.4 Confirmation Dialogs (COMPLETED)
- Created reusable ConfirmDialog component with hook pattern
- Integrated across all destructive operations:
  - MatrixPlannerView, Settings, Subjects, Calendar
  - SmartPlanner, StudyPlanManager, EnhancedMatrixEditor
- Three severity levels: danger (red), warning (yellow), info (blue)
- Modal backdrop prevents accidental dismissal

#### 🔄 8.3 Calendar Redesign (IN PROGRESS)
**Planned Changes**:
- Tab-based navigation replacing side-by-side layout
- Full viewport width for calendar when active
- Minimum cell height: 150px (from 80px)
- Font size: 14px minimum (from 10px)
- Zoom levels: Small (120px), Medium (150px), Large (200px)
- Month view addition to week/day views
- Floating action buttons for common tasks

#### ⏳ 8.5 Timer Controls (PENDING)
- Minimum button size: 48x48px
- Clear play/pause/stop states
- Session type selector prominent
- Progress ring visualization

#### ⏳ 8.2 Layout Simplification (PENDING)
- Remove duplicate functionality
- Consolidate similar features
- Reduce cognitive load

### Component Synchronization Status

**In Sync** ✅:
- SmartPlanner (matrix, calendar, plans)
- Settings (with confirmations)

**Out of Sync** ⚠️:
- **Today's Plan**: Not using latest chapter status from matrix
- **Progress Tab**: Not reflecting matrix progress updates
- **Subjects Tab**: Duplicate of matrix, needs consolidation
- **Calendar Tab**: Old exam UI, needs matrix integration
- **Collaboration**: Placeholder features only

### Testing Strategy for Phase 8
```typescript
// Critical user flows to test after redesign
1. Add chapter → View in calendar → Start timer → Complete
2. Switch views → Verify data consistency
3. Mobile responsive → Touch targets → Readability
4. Confirmation dialogs → Prevent data loss
5. Calendar zoom → Cell visibility → Task labels
```

## Next Immediate Actions (Phase 9 Priority - Activity Planning)
1. 🆕 Implement chapter-to-calendar assignment modal (9.1)
2. 🆕 Add smart timer completion flow (9.2)
3. 🆕 Build pause/resume capability (9.3)
4. 🆕 Create activity tracking system (9.4)
5. 🆕 Design performance dashboard (9.5)
6. ⏳ Complete remaining Phase 8 items

## Completed Actions (Phase 8)
1. ✅ Implement confirmation dialogs (8.4) - COMPLETED
2. 🔄 Redesign calendar with tab layout (8.3) - IN PROGRESS
3. ⏳ Enhance timer controls visibility (8.5)
4. ⏳ Simplify overall layout (8.2)
5. ⏳ Create comprehensive test suite
6. ⏳ Sync all tabs with matrix state
