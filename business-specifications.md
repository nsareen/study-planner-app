## Technical Implementation

### Development Guidelines for Vercel Deployment

#### TypeScript Configuration
- **CRITICAL**: Use `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` in tsconfig.json
- **Type Imports**: Always use `import type` for TypeScript types
  ```typescript
  // ✅ Correct
  import type { Chapter, Exam } from '../types';
  
  // ❌ Incorrect - will fail build
  import { Chapter, Exam } from '../types';
  ```
- **Strict Mode**: Enable all strict TypeScript checks
- **No Implicit Any**: Ensure all variables have explicit types

#### Tailwind CSS Configuration
- **CommonJS Configs**: Use `.cjs` extension for config files
  - `tailwind.config.cjs` instead of `.js`
  - `postcss.config.cjs` for PostCSS
- **Content Paths**: Explicitly define all content paths
  ```javascript
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ]
  ```
- **Vite Configuration**: Explicitly configure PostCSS in vite.config.ts
  ```typescript
  css: {
    postcss: {
      plugins: [
        tailwindcss('./tailwind.config.cjs'),
        autoprefixer,
      ],
    },
  }
  ```

#### Build & Deployment Best Practices
- **Branch Strategy**: 
  - Feature branches for development: `feature/[feature-name]`
  - Bug fix branches: `bugfix/[issue-name]`
  - Test locally before merging to main
  - Main branch auto-deploys to Vercel
- **Local Testing**: Always run `npm run build` before pushing
- **Bundle Size**: Keep chunks under 500KB
  - Use dynamic imports for large components
  - Implement code splitting
- **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for configuration
  - Never commit sensitive data
  - Use Vercel environment variables for production

#### Component Development Guidelines
- **File Structure**: One component per file
- **Props Interface**: Always define TypeScript interfaces for props
- **Default Props**: Use default parameters or defaultProps
- **Error Boundaries**: Wrap complex components
- **Loading States**: Always handle loading and error states
- **Accessibility**: Include ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

#### State Management
- **Zustand Store**: 
  - Separate slices for different domains
  - Use immer for immutable updates
  - Implement proper TypeScript typing
- **Local Storage**: 
  - Handle quota exceeded errors
  - Implement data compression for large datasets
  - Regular cleanup of old data
- **Performance**: 
  - Use React.memo for expensive components
  - Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
  - Debounce user inputs

#### CSS & Styling
- **Mobile First**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
- **Responsive Units**: Use rem/em instead of px where appropriate
- **CSS Variables**: Define theme variables in CSS
- **Animation Performance**: Use transform and opacity for animations
- **Print Styles**: Include print media queries

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Test utilities and store functions
- **Component Tests**: Test user interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Test critical user flows
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure WCAG compliance
